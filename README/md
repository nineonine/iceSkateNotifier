### IceSkate Drop-in Sesstion Notifier

Just a simple lambda function that queries API to check if ice skating drop-in sessions are available.

Configure email and mobile via environment variables.

Note that currently lambda is triggered by EventBridge.

TODO:
- CloudFormation for end2end deployment
- more notification destinations
- add session URLs to email notification
